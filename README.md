# SpellDensity
Sets the CVAR, spellVisualDensityFilterSetting, to 1 upon logging in or changing zones.

This WoW addon was inspired by several WeakAuras (RIP) which performed the same function.
No customization is provided, other than editing the SpellDensity.lua file, as illustrated below.

```
local DEFAULT_spellVisualDensityFilterSetting = 1
```
